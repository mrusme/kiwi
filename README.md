Kiwi
----

Kiwi – **K**eyboard **I**nterface for **W**ireless **I**nteraction – is a 
[Nerves](https://github.com/nerves-project)-based firmware for 
[Pimoroni Keybow](https://learn.pimoroni.com/keybow) that transforms the device 
into a powerful wireless (WiFi) controller for Philips Hue, IFTTT, OBS and
everything else that has an HTTP API!

With Kiwi, you can turn your Pimoroni Keybow into a poor-man's Elgato Stream
Deck!

## Requirements

- 2.4 GHz WiFi
- [Pimoroni 
  Keybow](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/keybow?variant=21246333190227)
- microSD card

## Installation

- Download the latest firmware (`kiwi.tar.gz`) from the 
  [releases page](https://github.com/mrusme/kiwi/releases/latest) and unpack 
  it it: `tar -xzf kiwi.tar.gz`
- Insert the microSD card into the card reader of your computer
- Raw-copy the firmware to your microSD card, e.g. using `dd`: 
  `sudo dd bs=1m if=./kiwi.fw of=/dev/SDCARD_DEVICE` (where `SDCARD_DEVICE` is 
  your microSD card, e.g. `/dev/rdisk3`)
- If your computer did not automatically mount a partition (`BOOT-A`) from the 
  microSD card after the copy has finished, eject the card and plug it back in
- Open the folder of your mounted partition (`BOOT-A`) and create a file named 
  `kiwi.txt` (small caps, no spaces) with 
  [the following content](kiwi.txt).
- Adjust the SSID, the PSK (and the KEY_MGMT) values according to your WiFi 
  configuration
- If you want to control [OBS](https://obsproject.com) from Kiwi, fill 
  `NERVES_NETWORK_OBS_SOCKET` with the URL to the OBS web-socket, otherwise 
  remove the whole line
- Save the file and unmount the partition
- Insert the microSD card into your Keybow and connect it to a power source
- Check your WiFi access point's web-interface to find out the IP address that 
  was assigned to your Keybow

## Configuration

As soon as you found the IP you can start configuring the device via its API.

## API

The Kiwi API is accessible via `http://10.10.10.10:8080/` (where `10.10.10.10` 
is the IP address of the Keybow on your WiFi). Check out the full [OpenAPI 3
specification](https://github.com/mrusme/kiwi/blob/master/api.yaml)!

> Note: All example API calls in this documentation are being performed using 
> [`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se), as it's available for the majority of 
> platforms.

### Endpoint: Settings

The Kiwi API provides a `/settings` endpoint for configuring each individual 
key.

#### **GET** `/settings`

Retrieve a list of all currently configured settings (e.g. for backing up your 
current configuration).

```sh
curl "http://10.10.10.10:8080/settings" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{}'
```

#### **POST** `/settings`

Bulk upsert endpoint, allows upserting a list of settings (e.g. for recovery of 
a backup). This endpoint can be used for importing a backed-up configuration.

```sh
curl -X "POST" "http://10.10.10.10:8080/settings" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{
          "settings": [
            {
              "id": "key_1_in_row_1",
              "object": {
                "keydown": {
                  "http": [

                    ...

                  ]
                }
              }
            },
            {
              "id": "animation_main",
              "object": {
                "frames": [

                    ...

                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        }'
```

#### **GET** `/settings/keys`

Retrieve a list of all currently configured keys.

```sh
curl "http://10.10.10.10:8080/settings/keys" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{}'
```

#### **GET** `/settings/keys/:key`

Retrieve the current configuration for a specific key.

```sh
curl "http://10.10.10.10:8080/settings/keys/key_1_in_row_1" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{}'
```

#### **POST** `/settings/keys/:key`

`:key` can be one of the following values:

- `key_1_in_row_1`
- `key_2_in_row_1`
- `key_3_in_row_1`
- `key_1_in_row_2`
- `key_2_in_row_2`
- `key_3_in_row_2`
- `key_1_in_row_3`
- `key_2_in_row_3`
- `key_3_in_row_3`
- `key_1_in_row_4`
- `key_2_in_row_4`
- `key_3_in_row_4`

The key names relate to the position of the key on the Keybow when the device 
is in front of you with the `Keybow` label in the top right corner and the 
`pimoroni.com/keybow` url on the bottom right:

##### HTTP actions

HTTP actions allow you to run arbitrary HTTP requests (`GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, 
`DELETE`) in order to control basically everything that provides a more or less 
sane HTTP API, like IoT devices or web services. 

Let's have a look at an example:

In order to configure the first key of the first row to perform a HTTP post to 
[IFTTT's Maker Webhooks](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks) 
(click *Documentation* on that site) when it's pressed (down), run the 
following command:

```sh
curl -X POST "http://10.10.10.10:8080/settings/keys/key_1_in_row_1" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
    -d $'{
          "object": {
            "keydown": {
              "http": [
                {
                  "body": "{}",
                  "method": "post",
                  "headers": {
                    "content-type": "application/json"
                  },
                  "url": "https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger/key_1_in_row_1/with/key/your-ifttt-key-here"
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        }'
```

As soon as the curl command returns with HTTP status code `200 OK` the key was 
set up and its configuration stored to the Keybow's internal storage (which is 
the microSD card, of course). You can now press the key (the first one on the 
top left) to run the HTTP call.

However, you might have noticed, that the `http` property is not simply an 
object but rather an array containing objects. This allows you to define 
multiple HTTP actions to run with the press of a single button. In order to do 
so, simply add another HTTP request object to the `http` array:

```sh
curl -X POST "http://10.10.10.10:8080/settings/keys/key_1_in_row_1" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
    -d $'{
          "object": {
            "keydown": {
              "http": [
                {
                  "body": "{}",
                  "method": "post",
                  "headers": {
                    "content-type": "application/json"
                  },
                  "url": "https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger/turn_lights_off/with/key/your-ifttt-key-here"
                },
                {
                  "body": "{}",
                  "method": "post",
                  "headers": {
                    "content-type": "application/json"
                  },
                  "url": "https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger/power_on_television/with/key/your-ifttt-key-here"
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        }'
```

The HTTP requests defined within the `http` array are being run **one after 
another** (in the order defined within the array, from top to bottom) and not 
in parallel. This means that the second request waits for the first one to 
complete until it executes. Also keep in mind that, as of right now, subsequent 
requests don't care about their prior request's return status and will run no 
matter what.

##### Scripted HTTP actions (advanced topic)

Now that we've learned how HTTP requests work and that we can have multiple 
requests running one after another, we can dive deeper into how HTTP requests 
can be scripted.

Let's assume, you would like one button to trigger an API that turns a 
lightbulb on or off. The API accepts a boolean value as the lightbulb's state, 
with `true` being on, `false` being off. Now, in order to program a single 
button to trigger the lightbulb on **and** off with each keypress, you need to 
have a dynamic value within your request's body, that changes, depending on the 
current state of the lightbulb. This state could be retrieved inside a separate 
HTTP `GET` request that runs prior to the one updating the lightbulb's status.

Kiwi allows you to do just this. Let's have a look on how such a `http` 
definition could look like for a Philips Hue connected lightbulb:

```sh
curl -X "POST" "http://10.10.10.10:8080/settings/keys/key_1_in_row_1" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{
          "object": {
            "keydown": {
              "http": [
                {
                  "body": "{}",
                  "method": "get",
                  "headers": {
                    "content-type": "application/json"
                  },
                  "url": "http://YOUR-HUE-BRIDGE-IP-HERE/api/YOUR-GENERATED-USERNAME-HERE/lights/1"
                },
                {
                  "body": "{\\"on\\": <<{Map.get(previous_http_response, :body) |> Jason.decode!() |> Map.get(\\"state\\") |> Map.get(\\"on\\") |> Kernel.not}>>}",
                  "method": "put",
                  "headers": {
                    "content-type": "application/json"
                  },
                  "url": "http://YOUR-HUE-BRIDGE-IP-HERE/api/YOUR-GENERATED-USERNAME-HERE/lights/1/state"
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        }'
```

As you can see, we're doing two requests here. First, we run a `GET` request 
that retrieves the current status of the Hue lightbulb. In the second request 
then, we use the the scripted HTTP action feature within the request the body.
In order to make the script identifiable to Kiwi, it needs to be surrounded by 
`<<{}>>`. As script language we use Elixir.

Every request that uses scripting retrieves a variable named 
`previous_http_response` which either contains the HTTP response of the 
previously executed HTTP request or `nil`. `previous_http_response` is of type 
[`%Mojito.Response{}`](https://github.com/appcues/mojito). In this example, we 
extract the `body` from the `%Mojito.Response{}` (which is a JSON string) and 
decode it using `Jason.decode!`. Afterwards we `Map.get` the `state` map from 
the decoded body map and then `Map.get` its `on` property – which is a boolean 
value. If `on` is `true`, it means that our light is currently turned on. 
If it's `false`, it means that it's currently off. Last but not least, we pipe 
the boolean value to `Kernel.not`, which inverts the boolean state. The the 
inverted state is the return of this script, will be converted to a JSON 
representation and used as a value in the very place our `<<{ ... }>>` is.

The result of all this: If the current state of the lightbulb is `false`, it's 
being inverted to `true` and set as value for the `on` property inside our 
request's body. The request will then execute with a JSON body that says 
`{"on": true}`, so that the Hue turns the lightbulb on. When we press the key 
another time, the `GET` request will retrieve `true` inside of 
`response.body.state.on` and the upcoming `PUT` request will fetch this value, 
invert it and send `{"on": false}`, so that the light turns back off.

Scripted HTTP actions allow you to do many fancy things with little knowledge 
of HTTP requests and Elixir. However keep in mind that the scripts you write 
are being executed within the same environment in which Kiwi runs and have 
pretty much the same permissions (access keys, access LEDs, access your WiFi). 
Hence, always make sure to validate data that you retrieve from endpoints you 
have no control of!

##### LED actions

Of course you can also do crazy things with the integrated LEDs your Keybow has. 
In order to configure a fancy key-press light-animation, run the following 
command:

```sh
curl -X POST "http://10.10.10.10:8080/settings/keys/key_1_in_row_1" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{
          "object": {
            "keydown": {
              "led": {
                "frames": [
                  {
                    "sleep": 50,
                    "keys": {
                      "key_1_in_row_1": {
                        "brightness": 227,
                        "red": 55,
                        "blue": 0,
                        "green": 0
                      }
                    }
                  },
                  {
                    "sleep": 50,
                    "keys": {
                      "key_1_in_row_1": {
                        "brightness": 227,
                        "red": 155,
                        "blue": 0,
                        "green": 0
                      }
                    }
                  },
                  {
                    "sleep": 50,
                    "keys": {
                      "key_1_in_row_1": {
                        "brightness": 227,
                        "red": 255,
                        "blue": 0,
                        "green": 0
                      }
                    }
                  },
                  {
                    "sleep": 50,
                    "keys": {
                      "key_1_in_row_1": {
                        "brightness": 227,
                        "red": 155,
                        "blue": 0,
                        "green": 0
                      }
                    }
                  },
                  {
                    "sleep": 50,
                    "keys": {
                      "key_1_in_row_1": {
                        "brightness": 227,
                        "red": 55,
                        "blue": 0,
                        "green": 0
                      }
                    }
                  },
                  {
                    "sleep": 0,
                    "keys": {
                      "key_1_in_row_1": {
                        "brightness": 227,
                        "red": 0,
                        "blue": 0,
                        "green": 0
                      }
                    }
                  }
                ]
              }
            }
          }
        }'
```

When you now press the key, it should light up in red and quickly fade off. 
As you can see, `frames` is an array of animation frames containing the 
duration between each frame (`sleep`) and the `keys` that should be targeted. 
You can even specify multiple keys by adding them to the `keys` object.

##### Combined actions

Actions can be combined by adding all desired action to the JSON, e.g.:

```sh
curl -X "POST" "http://10.10.10.10:8080/settings/keys/key_2_in_row_1" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{
          "object": {
            "keydown": {
              "led": { ... },
              "http": [{ ... }]
            }
          }
        }'
```

#### **GET** `/settings/animations/:animation`

Retrieve the current configuration for a specific animation.

```sh
curl "http://10.10.10.10:8080/settings/animations/animation_main" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{}'
```

#### **POST** `/settings/animations/:animation`

This endpoint allows setting constantly playing LED animations on the keyboard. 
`:animation` defines the animation you'd like to define. By default, Kiwi loads 
the animation `animation_main`.

You can configure `animation_main` like this:

```sh
curl -X "POST" "http://10.10.10.10:8080/settings/animations/animation_main" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{
          "object": {
            "frames": [
              {
                "sleep": 500,
                "keys": {
                  "key_1_in_row_1": {
                    "red": 255,
                    "green": 0,
                    "blue": 0
                  }
                }
              },
              ...
              ...
              ...
              ...
              ...
            ]
          }
        }'
```

Alternatively you can use [image2kiwi](https://github.com/mrusme/image2kiwi) to 
generate an animation from a JPG, PNG, GIF, etc. Please refer to its 
documentation on how image generation works. Here's the curl example of how to 
set a generated animation:

```sh
curl -X "POST" "http://10.0.0.219:8080/settings/animations/animation_main" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d "{\"object\": {\"frames\": $(python3 ./image2kiwi.py ./rainbow.gif) }}"
```

![Animation](docs/image2kiwi-animation.gif)

*Notice: image2kiwi scales the image to max 3x4px. If you pass an image that's 
300x300px, its aspect will be kept and it will be scaled to 3x3px. Hence, the 
bottom three keys won't light up.*

## Integrations

### Philips Hue Bridge

Find the IP address of your Philips Hue Bridge on your network and create a 
dedicated user for Kiwi:

```sh
curl -X "POST" "http://YOUR-HUE-BRIDGE-IP-HERE/api" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{
          "devicetype": "kiwi#kiwi"
        }'
```

This request will return an auto-generated username. With this you can then 
check all your connected lights:

```sh
curl "http://YOUR-HUE-BRIDGE-IP-HERE/api/YOUR-GENERATED-USERNAME-HERE/lights" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{}'
```

After you've identified the light you'd like to turn on/off, configure two keys:

```sh
curl -X "POST" "http://10.10.10.10:8080/settings/keys/key_1_in_row_1" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{
          "object": {
            "keydown": {
              "http": [{
                "body": "{\\"on\\": true}",
                "method": "put",
                "headers": {
                  "content-type": "application/json"
                },
                "url": "http://YOUR-HUE-BRIDGE-IP-HERE/api/YOUR-GENERATED-USERNAME-HERE/lights/1/state"
              }]
            }
          }
        }'
```

```sh
curl -X "POST" "http://10.10.10.10:8080/settings/keys/key_2_in_row_1" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -d $'{
          "object": {
            "keydown": {
              "http": {
                "body": "{\\"on\\": false}",
                "method": "put",
                "headers": {
                  "content-type": "application/json"
                },
                "url": "http://YOUR-HUE-BRIDGE-IP-HERE/api/YOUR-GENERATED-USERNAME-HERE/lights/1/state"
              }
            }
          }
        }'
```

That's it!

## Development

### Requirements

- WiFi
- Pimoroni Keybow
- An empty microSD card
- Elixir installed on your computer

### Installation

Make sure to have Erlang and Elixir installed on your computer!

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mrusme/kiwi.git
$ cd kiwi
$ make dependencies
```

*Note: For development it makes sense that you enable the WiFi configuration 
block within `config/config.exs`, so that you can pass the WiFi config via 
environment variables during the build.*

Insert microSD card into the microSD card reader of your computer and find its 
block device, e.g. /dev/disk3 (on a Mac), unmount it and use its raw version:

```bash
$ diskutil umountDisk /dev/disk3
$ NERVES_NETWORK_KEY_MGMT=WPA-PSK NERVES_NETWORK_SSID=yourWifiNetworkName NERVES_NETWORK_PSK=yourWiFiPassword SD_CARD=/dev/rdisk3 make sdcard
```

Eject the microSD card, insert it into your Keybow's Raspberry Pi Zero and 
connect it to a power source.

### Configuration

As soon as the device has booted it should be connected to the WiFi. If it 
isn't you probably screwed up `NERVES_NETWORK_KEY_MGMT`, `NERVES_NETWORK_SSID` 
and/or `NERVES_NETWORK_PSK` and need to re-run the installation with correct 
values.\
Sorry.

Check your WiFi access point's web-interface to find out the IP address that 
was assigned to your Keybow. As soon as you found the IP you can start 
configuring the device via its API.

### Hardware information

Here's some useful information if you might want to start contributing to this 
project yourself and want to save yourself from having to browse the 
official (undocumented!) Keybow's firmware code.

[@Gadgetoid](https://github.com/Gadgetoid) provided very good 
[insight on this topic here](https://github.com/pimoroni/keybow-firmware/issues/23#issuecomment-486163227). 
Quote:

> This magic number is the LED frame marker, which is indicated by 3 high bits set to 1: 0b11100000 plus 5 bits of global (applies to R, G and B LEds in a package) brightness: 0b00011111 (giving an 0-31 brightness range). Since we don't want to drive at maximum brightness, but still want colours to have the full 255255255 range, we use global brightness to handle the dimming across the LEDs.

## Troubleshooting

### Have you tried turning it off and on again?

In most cases, simply unplugging and plugging the Keybow back in will fix every 
issue that might occur during runtime.

### Investigating

You can connect to your Kiwi instance through SSH:

```sh
ssh root@10.10.10.10
```

There you'll end up inside a IEx in which you can start investigating your 
issue. Keep in mind that there will be no Logger output unless you execute 
`RingLogger.next` or attach to the RingLogger using `RingLogger.attach`.
